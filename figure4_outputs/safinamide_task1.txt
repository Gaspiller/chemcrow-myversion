=== TASK ===
I need to synthesize a sample of safinamide.
    Please tell me how to synthesize it. Then tell me 
    how much will it cost to buy all the reactants I need, if purchasable.

=== Answer with Tools ===
I'm sorry, but I was unable to find a synthesis route for safinamide in the scientific literature. Therefore, I cannot provide an estimate for the cost of the reactants.

=== Answer without Tools ===
Safinamide is a complex molecule that requires advanced knowledge in organic chemistry to synthesize. It's important to note that the synthesis of such substances should only be performed by trained professionals in a controlled laboratory environment. Here is a simplified version of the synthesis process:

1. Start with 2,6-dichlorobenzyl chloride and react it with sodium azide in dimethylformamide (DMF) to get 2,6-dichlorobenzyl azide.

2. The 2,6-dichlorobenzyl azide is then reacted with triphenylphosphine in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to get 2,6-dichlorobenzylamine.

3. The 2,6-dichlorobenzylamine is then reacted with (S)-tert-butyl 2-methylpropan-2-ylcarbamate in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) to get the desired safinamide.

Please note that this is a simplified version of the synthesis and the actual process may involve additional steps and purification processes.

As for the cost, it's difficult to provide an exact estimate as prices can vary greatly depending on the supplier, the quantity you're purchasing, and the purity of the chemicals. However, here are some rough estimates:

- 2,6-dichlorobenzyl chloride: $50-100 per 100g
- Sodium azide: $50-100 per 100g
- DMF: $20-50 per liter
- Triphenylphosphine: $100-200 per 100g
- THF: $20-50 per liter
- (S)-tert-butyl 2-methylpropan-2-ylcarbamate: This is a more specialized chemical and may be more expensive, possibly several hundred dollars for a small quantity.
- EDC: $50-100 per 100g
- HOBt: $100-200 per 100g

Again, these are rough estimates and actual prices may vary. Also, keep in mind that the synthesis of safinamide may require additional chemicals and equipment not listed here.

=== Teacher Evaluation ===
Student 1's Grade: 4
Strengths: Student 1 was honest about their inability to find a synthesis route for safinamide, which shows integrity.
Weaknesses: The student did not demonstrate problem-solving skills or resourcefulness. They could have tried to find alternative sources or methods to obtain the information. They also did not attempt to provide an estimate for the cost of the reactants, which was part of the task.
Justification: While honesty is appreciated, the student did not fully attempt to complete the task. They could have shown more initiative and resourcefulness in trying to find the information.

Student 2's Grade: 9
Strengths: Student 2 provided a detailed and clear synthesis process for safinamide, demonstrating a good understanding of organic chemistry. They also provided a disclaimer about the complexity of the process and the need for professional handling, showing responsibility and awareness of safety. They also attempted to provide a cost estimate for the reactants, showing effort to complete the task fully.
Weaknesses: The student could have provided more precise cost estimates or a range for the more specialized chemical. They also could have mentioned that the cost estimates are subject to change and depend on various factors.
Justification: Student 2 demonstrated a good understanding of the subject matter, responsibility, and effort to complete the task fully. However, there is room for improvement in providing more precise cost estimates.
