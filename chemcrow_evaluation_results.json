    "task_1": "Safinamide is a complex molecule and its synthesis involves multiple steps. Here is a simplified version of the synthesis:\n\n1. Start with 2,6-dichlorobenzyl chloride and react it with sodium azide in DMF to get 2,6-dichlorobenzyl azide.\n\n2. The azide is then reduced to an amine using hydrogen gas and a palladium catalyst to yield 2,6-dichlorobenzylamine.\n\n3. The amine is then reacted with 5-fluoro-2-methoxybenzoyl chloride in the presence of a base like triethylamine to yield the amide.\n\n4. The dichloro compound is then reacted with sodium methoxide to replace one of the chlorines with a methoxy group to yield safinamide.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of the synthesis and actual laboratory synthesis may require additional steps and optimizations.\n\nAs for the cost, it's difficult to provide an exact estimate as prices can vary greatly depending on the supplier, the quantity you're buying, and the purity you need. However, here are some rough estimates:\n\n- 2,6-dichlorobenzyl chloride: $50-100 per 100g\n- Sodium azide: $25-50 per 100g\n- DMF: $15-30 per 500ml\n- Hydrogen gas: costs can vary, but cylinders can be rented for around $30-50 per month\n- Palladium catalyst: this can be quite expensive, potentially several hundred dollars for a small amount\n- 5-fluoro-2-methoxybenzoyl chloride: this may need to be synthesized from other starting materials, which would add to the cost\n- Triethylamine: $20-40 per 500ml\n- Sodium methoxide: $20-40 per 100g\n\nPlease note that these are rough estimates and actual prices can vary. Additionally, this doesn't include any costs for equipment, labor, or waste disposal. Also, keep in mind that some of these chemicals are hazardous and should only be handled by trained professionals.",
    "task_2": "Designing an organocatalyst for enhancing carbon dioxide conversion in carbon capture and utilization processes is a challenging task. However, considering the properties of CO2 and the principles of organic chemistry, I propose a novel organocatalyst based on a quaternary ammonium salt structure.\n\nThe organocatalyst would be a quaternary ammonium salt with a sterically hindered, electron-rich aromatic group attached to the nitrogen atom. This aromatic group would enhance the nucleophilicity of the catalyst, allowing it to react more readily with CO2. The quaternary ammonium salt structure would provide the necessary positive charge to polarize the CO2 molecule, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n\nThe structure of the organocatalyst could be further optimized by introducing electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring to increase its electron density and thus its nucleophilicity. Additionally, bulky alkyl groups could be attached to the nitrogen atom to increase the steric hindrance around it, which would further enhance the selectivity of the catalyst towards CO2.\n\nThis organocatalyst would work by first reacting with CO2 to form a carbamate intermediate. This intermediate could then be further converted into useful products such as methanol or formic acid, depending on the specific conditions and co-catalysts used.\n\nThis is a novel approach because most current CO2 conversion catalysts are based on transition metals, which can be expensive and environmentally harmful. An organocatalyst like the one proposed here would be cheaper, more sustainable, and potentially more selective for CO2 conversion.",
    "task_3": "1. Reaction of Ethylidenecyclohexane with HBr:\n\nIn the absence of peroxides, the reaction of ethylidenecyclohexane with HBr follows a Markovnikov addition mechanism. The HBr adds across the double bond, with the bromine attaching to the more substituted carbon due to the stability of the carbocation intermediate. The product of this reaction would be 1-bromoethylcyclohexane.\n\n2. Reaction of Ethylidenecyclohexane with HBr in the presence of Methyl Peroxide:\n\nIn the presence of peroxides like methyl peroxide, the reaction follows an anti-Markovnikov addition mechanism, also known as a free radical mechanism. The peroxide initiates a free radical chain reaction where the bromine attaches to the less substituted carbon of the double bond. The product of this reaction would be 2-bromoethylcyclohexane.\n\nComparison:\n\nThe two products are regioisomers of each other. The product of the reaction in the absence of peroxides is 1-bromoethylcyclohexane (Markovnikov product), while the product in the presence of peroxides is 2-bromoethylcyclohexane (anti-Markovnikov product). The difference in products is due to the different mechanisms of the reactions. The first reaction proceeds via a carbocation intermediate, while the second proceeds via a free radical mechanism.",
    "task_4": "The most common and effective insect repellent is DEET (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide). Here is a simple synthesis plan for DEET:\n\n1. Start with m-toluic acid (1), which is commercially available. \n\n2. Convert m-toluic acid to its acid chloride (2) using thionyl chloride (SOCl2). \n\n3. React the acid chloride with diethylamine (3) to give DEET (4).\n\nHere is the reaction scheme:\n\n1. m-Toluic acid + SOCl2 -> m-Toluoyl chloride + SO2 + HCl\n2. m-Toluoyl chloride + (C2H5)2NH -> DEET + HCl\n\nFor 100g of DEET, you will need:\n\n1. m-Toluic acid: DEET has a molar mass of about 192 g/mol, so you will need about 0.52 moles of m-toluic acid. Given that m-toluic acid has a molar mass of about 136 g/mol, you will need about 71g of m-toluic acid. The cost of m-toluic acid is approximately $30 for 500g.\n\n2. Thionyl chloride: You will need about 0.52 moles of thionyl chloride. Given that thionyl chloride has a molar mass of about 119 g/mol, you will need about 62g of thionyl chloride. The cost of thionyl chloride is approximately $25 for 100g.\n\n3. Diethylamine: You will need about 0.52 moles of diethylamine. Given that diethylamine has a molar mass of about 73 g/mol, you will need about 38g of diethylamine. The cost of diethylamine is approximately $20 for 100g.\n\nPlease note that these prices are approximate and can vary based on supplier and quantity purchased. Also, this synthesis should be performed in a well-equipped chemical laboratory under the supervision of a trained chemist due to the hazardous nature of the chemicals involved.",

    "task_6": "1. Reaction with Lindlar's Catalyst:\n\nLindlar's catalyst is a palladium-based catalyst used to perform hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes. It is a heterogeneous catalyst that selectively hydrogenates alkynes to cis-alkenes (Z-alkenes) without further reaction to alkanes.\n\nIn the case of 1-Chloro-4-ethynylbenzene, the Lindlar's catalyst will hydrogenate the ethynyl group (C≡C) to an ethenyl group (C=C), resulting in the formation of 1-Chloro-4-vinylbenzene. The reaction mechanism involves the adsorption of the alkyne and hydrogen onto the catalyst surface, followed by the formation of a metal-alkyne complex. The hydrogen then adds syn (from the same side) to the alkyne, forming a cis-alkene.\n\n2. Reaction with Palladium Catalyst:\n\nWhen the Lindlar's catalyst is replaced with a simple palladium catalyst (denoted as [Pd]), the reaction will proceed differently. Palladium is a powerful catalyst for the hydrogenation of alkynes, and without the presence of lead and quinoline (which are part of the Lindlar's catalyst and prevent full hydrogenation), the alkyne will be fully hydrogenated to an alkane.\n\nSo, in the case of 1-Chloro-4-ethynylbenzene, the palladium catalyst will hydrogenate the ethynyl group (C≡C) all the way to an ethyl group (C-C), resulting in the formation of 1-Chloro-4-ethylbenzene. The reaction mechanism is similar to that of the Lindlar's catalyst, but without the inhibition of full hydrogenation, so the hydrogen adds twice, converting the alkyne to an alkane.\n\n3. Comparison of the Two Products:\n\nThe product of the reaction with Lindlar's catalyst, 1-Chloro-4-vinylbenzene, is a cis-alkene, while the product of the reaction with the palladium catalyst, 1-Chloro-4-ethylbenzene, is an alkane. The difference in these products is due to the selectivity of the two catalysts: Lindlar's catalyst selectively hydrogenates alkynes to cis-alkenes, while palladium fully hydrogenates alkynes to alkanes.",
    "task_7": "The molecule similar to paracetamol (acetaminophen) without a methylamide group could be phenol. Phenol has a similar structure to paracetamol but lacks the methylamide group. \n\nThe price of phenol varies depending on the quantity and purity, but it is generally affordable and widely available. For example, a 500g bottle of phenol (crystals, ≥99.5% purity) can be purchased for around $50-60 USD from various chemical suppliers.\n\nHowever, if you want to synthesize phenol in a laboratory setting, here is a possible synthetic route:\n\n1. Start with benzene as the starting material. Benzene is a readily available and inexpensive compound.\n\n2. Perform a nitration reaction on benzene to produce nitrobenzene. This involves the use of nitric acid and sulfuric acid.\n\n3. Reduce the nitro group in nitrobenzene to an amino group to produce aniline. This can be done using a reducing agent like tin and hydrochloric acid.\n\n4. Finally, perform a diazotization reaction on aniline to produce phenol. This involves the use of nitrous acid (which can be made from sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid) and water.\n\nPlease note that all these reactions should be performed under the supervision of a trained chemist and in a controlled laboratory environment, as they involve the use of potentially hazardous chemicals.",
    "task_8": "The synthesis of Ricci's organocatalyst can be achieved in three steps:\n\n1. Synthesis of (1R,2S)-2-hydroxy-1-indanone: This can be achieved by the asymmetric reduction of 1-indanone using a chiral reducing agent such as (R)-(+)-Me-CBS-oxazaborolidine in the presence of borane. The reaction proceeds via an enantioselective borane reduction to give the (1R,2S)-2-hydroxy-1-indanone.\n\n2. Reaction of (1R,2S)-2-hydroxy-1-indanone with 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl isothiocyanate: The (1R,2S)-2-hydroxy-1-indanone is then reacted with 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl isothiocyanate in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. This reaction proceeds via a nucleophilic attack of the oxygen atom of the hydroxy group on the isothiocyanate to form a thiocarbamate intermediate.\n\n3. Cyclization to form Ricci's organocatalyst: The thiocarbamate intermediate is then cyclized under acidic conditions to form Ricci's organocatalyst. This reaction proceeds via an intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen atom on the carbonyl carbon atom of the thiocarbamate, followed by protonation of the oxygen atom to form the thiourea.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of the synthesis and the actual process may require additional steps and optimizations to achieve good yields and enantioselectivity. Also, all reactions should be carried out under an inert atmosphere (e.g., nitrogen or argon) and the products should be purified by appropriate methods such as column chromatography.",
    "task_9": "The reaction between 2-bromo-2-methylpropane and 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one is not a typical reaction that would occur under normal conditions. \n\n2-bromo-2-methylpropane is a tertiary alkyl halide, which is typically reactive in nucleophilic substitution reactions (SN1) or elimination reactions (E1). However, 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one is a ketone with a phenolic hydroxyl group, which is not a good nucleophile. \n\nThe phenolic hydroxyl group can act as a weak nucleophile, but it would not typically react with a tertiary alkyl halide like 2-bromo-2-methylpropane. The carbonyl group of the ketone is also not a good site for nucleophilic attack by the alkyl halide.\n\nTherefore, without a strong base or acid to facilitate the reaction, or without a more reactive nucleophile, it is unlikely that these two compounds would react under normal conditions. \n\nIf you were to force the reaction under harsh conditions, it's possible that some sort of reaction could occur, but it would likely be a complex mixture of products due to multiple possible reaction sites and pathways. \n\nIn conclusion, this reaction would not typically occur without problems under normal conditions.",

    "task_12": "Atorvastatin, also known as Lipitor, is a complex molecule that is used to lower cholesterol levels. It's a prescription medication and its synthesis is not a simple process. It involves multiple steps, each requiring specific reactants, catalysts, and conditions. The synthesis of atorvastatin is a patented process and is typically carried out by pharmaceutical companies in a controlled laboratory environment.\n\nThe synthesis of atorvastatin involves several steps:\n\n1. The first step is the synthesis of the pyrrole core of the molecule. This is typically done by reacting an appropriate diketone with ammonia or an amine.\n\n2. The pyrrole is then functionalized with various groups to give the final atorvastatin molecule. This involves several steps, including halogenation, nitration, reduction, acylation, and cyclization reactions.\n\n3. The final step is the formation of the lactone ring, which is typically done by a ring-closing metathesis reaction.\n\nEach of these steps requires specific reactants and catalysts, and the conditions must be carefully controlled to ensure the correct product is formed. Furthermore, each step will likely require purification of the product before moving on to the next step.\n\nAs for the cost, it's difficult to give an exact figure without knowing the quantities you're planning to synthesize and the specific suppliers you'd be using for the reactants and catalysts. However, it's safe to say that the cost would likely be in the thousands of dollars, if not more. This is due to the cost of the reactants and catalysts, as well as the equipment and facilities needed to carry out the reactions.\n\nIn terms of whether it's cheaper to make it yourself rather than buying it, the answer is almost certainly no. The synthesis of atorvastatin is a complex process that requires a high level of expertise and expensive equipment. Furthermore, the cost of the reactants and catalysts is likely to be high. In contrast, atorvastatin is a generic medication and is relatively inexpensive to buy.\n\nFinally, it's important to note that the synthesis of pharmaceuticals is heavily regulated to ensure the safety and efficacy of the final product. Unauthorized synthesis of such compounds can be illegal and potentially dangerous. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new medication.",
