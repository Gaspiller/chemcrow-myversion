    "task_1": "Safinamide is a complex molecule and its synthesis involves multiple steps. Here is a simplified version of the synthesis:\n\n1. Start with 2,6-dichlorobenzyl chloride and react it with sodium azide in DMF to get 2,6-dichlorobenzyl azide.\n\n2. The azide is then reduced to an amine using hydrogen gas and a palladium catalyst to yield 2,6-dichlorobenzylamine.\n\n3. The amine is then reacted with 5-fluoro-2-methoxybenzoyl chloride in the presence of a base like triethylamine to yield the amide.\n\n4. The dichloro compound is then reacted with sodium methoxide to replace one of the chlorines with a methoxy group to yield safinamide.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of the synthesis and actual laboratory synthesis may require additional steps and optimizations.\n\nAs for the cost, it's difficult to provide an exact estimate as prices can vary greatly depending on the supplier, the quantity you're buying, and the purity you need. However, here are some rough estimates:\n\n- 2,6-dichlorobenzyl chloride: $50-100 per 100g\n- Sodium azide: $25-50 per 100g\n- DMF: $15-30 per 500ml\n- Hydrogen gas: costs can vary, but cylinders can be rented for around $30-50 per month\n- Palladium catalyst: this can be quite expensive, potentially several hundred dollars for a small amount\n- 5-fluoro-2-methoxybenzoyl chloride: this may need to be synthesized from other starting materials, which would add to the cost\n- Triethylamine: $20-40 per 500ml\n- Sodium methoxide: $20-40 per 100g\n\nPlease note that these are rough estimates and actual prices can vary. Additionally, this doesn't include any costs for equipment, labor, or waste disposal. Also, keep in mind that some of these chemicals are hazardous and should only be handled by trained professionals.",
    "task_2": "Designing an organocatalyst for enhancing carbon dioxide conversion in carbon capture and utilization processes is a challenging task. However, considering the properties of CO2 and the principles of organic chemistry, I propose a novel organocatalyst based on a quaternary ammonium salt structure.\n\nThe organocatalyst would be a quaternary ammonium salt with a sterically hindered, electron-rich aromatic group attached to the nitrogen atom. This aromatic group would enhance the nucleophilicity of the catalyst, allowing it to react more readily with CO2. The quaternary ammonium salt structure would provide the necessary positive charge to polarize the CO2 molecule, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n\nThe structure of the organocatalyst could be further optimized by introducing electron-donating groups on the aromatic ring to increase its electron density and thus its nucleophilicity. Additionally, bulky alkyl groups could be attached to the nitrogen atom to increase the steric hindrance around it, which would further enhance the selectivity of the catalyst towards CO2.\n\nThis organocatalyst would work by first reacting with CO2 to form a carbamate intermediate. This intermediate could then be further converted into useful products such as methanol or formic acid, depending on the specific conditions and co-catalysts used.\n\nThis is a novel approach because most current CO2 conversion catalysts are based on transition metals, which can be expensive and environmentally harmful. An organocatalyst like the one proposed here would be cheaper, more sustainable, and potentially more selective for CO2 conversion.",
    "task_3": "1. Reaction of Ethylidenecyclohexane with HBr:\n\nIn the absence of peroxides, the reaction of ethylidenecyclohexane with HBr follows a Markovnikov addition mechanism. The HBr adds across the double bond, with the bromine attaching to the more substituted carbon due to the stability of the carbocation intermediate. The product of this reaction would be 1-bromoethylcyclohexane.\n\n2. Reaction of Ethylidenecyclohexane with HBr in the presence of Methyl Peroxide:\n\nIn the presence of peroxides like methyl peroxide, the reaction follows an anti-Markovnikov addition mechanism, also known as a free radical mechanism. The peroxide initiates a free radical chain reaction where the bromine attaches to the less substituted carbon of the double bond. The product of this reaction would be 2-bromoethylcyclohexane.\n\nComparison:\n\nThe two products are regioisomers of each other. The product of the reaction in the absence of peroxides is 1-bromoethylcyclohexane (Markovnikov product), while the product in the presence of peroxides is 2-bromoethylcyclohexane (anti-Markovnikov product). The difference in products is due to the different mechanisms of the reactions. The first reaction proceeds via a carbocation intermediate, while the second proceeds via a free radical mechanism.",
    "task_4": "The most common and effective insect repellent is DEET (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide). Here is a simple synthesis plan for DEET:\n\n1. Start with m-toluic acid (1), which is commercially available. \n\n2. Convert m-toluic acid to its acid chloride (2) using thionyl chloride (SOCl2). \n\n3. React the acid chloride with diethylamine (3) to give DEET (4).\n\nHere is the reaction scheme:\n\n1. m-Toluic acid + SOCl2 -> m-Toluoyl chloride + SO2 + HCl\n2. m-Toluoyl chloride + (C2H5)2NH -> DEET + HCl\n\nFor 100g of DEET, you will need:\n\n1. m-Toluic acid: DEET has a molar mass of about 192 g/mol, so you will need about 0.52 moles of m-toluic acid. Given that m-toluic acid has a molar mass of about 136 g/mol, you will need about 71g of m-toluic acid. The cost of m-toluic acid is approximately $30 for 500g.\n\n2. Thionyl chloride: You will need about 0.52 moles of thionyl chloride. Given that thionyl chloride has a molar mass of about 119 g/mol, you will need about 62g of thionyl chloride. The cost of thionyl chloride is approximately $25 for 100g.\n\n3. Diethylamine: You will need about 0.52 moles of diethylamine. Given that diethylamine has a molar mass of about 73 g/mol, you will need about 38g of diethylamine. The cost of diethylamine is approximately $20 for 100g.\n\nPlease note that these prices are approximate and can vary based on supplier and quantity purchased. Also, this synthesis should be performed in a well-equipped chemical laboratory under the supervision of a trained chemist due to the hazardous nature of the chemicals involved."
