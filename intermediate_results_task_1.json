    "task_1": "Safinamide is a drug used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Its synthesis involves several steps and requires a good understanding of organic chemistry. Here is a simplified version of the synthesis:\n\n1. Start with 2,3-dichlorobenzaldehyde and react it with methylamine to form an imine.\n\n2. The imine is then reduced using sodium borohydride to form 2,3-dichlorophenethylamine.\n\n3. The 2,3-dichlorophenethylamine is then reacted with trifluoroacetic anhydride to form a trifluoroacetamide.\n\n4. The trifluoroacetamide is then reacted with sodium methoxide to form the methoxy derivative.\n\n5. The methoxy derivative is then reacted with sodium hydride and then with bromoacetonitrile to form the nitrile derivative.\n\n6. The nitrile derivative is then hydrolyzed using sulfuric acid to form the carboxylic acid derivative.\n\n7. The carboxylic acid derivative is then reacted with thionyl chloride to form the acid chloride derivative.\n\n8. The acid chloride derivative is then reacted with ammonia to form safinamide.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of the synthesis and the actual process may involve additional steps and purification processes.\n\nAs for the cost of the reactants, it's difficult to provide an exact figure without knowing the quantities you need, your location, and the supplier you're using. However, here are some rough estimates:\n\n- 2,3-dichlorobenzaldehyde: $50-100 per kilogram\n- Methylamine: $10-20 per kilogram\n- Sodium borohydride: $50-100 per kilogram\n- Trifluoroacetic anhydride: $100-200 per kilogram\n- Sodium methoxide: $50-100 per kilogram\n- Sodium hydride: $50-100 per kilogram\n- Bromoacetonitrile: $100-200 per kilogram\n- Sulfuric acid: $10-20 per kilogram\n- Thionyl chloride: $100-200 per kilogram\n- Ammonia: $10-20 per kilogram\n\nPlease note that these are rough estimates and the actual prices may vary. Also, keep in mind that the synthesis of safinamide should be carried out by a trained chemist in a properly equipped laboratory due to the potential hazards associated with some of the reactants and the complexity of the process."
